# Blockchain-based-Certificate-Issuance

## Project Description
This smart contract allows an authorized issuer to issue digital certificates to recipients by storing certificate hashes on-chain. Anyone can verify the authenticity of a certificate by querying the stored hash, ensuring tamper-proof and publicly verifiable certification.

## Project Vision
To provide a transparent, immutable, and easily verifiable way to issue academic, professional, or any other type of certificates on the blockchain, eliminating fraud and simplifying verification processes.


## Future Scope
- Support multiple issuers with permission management
- Enable certificate revocation and updates
- Integrate with IPFS or other decentralized storage for certificate metadata
- Build front-end portals for user-friendly certificate management
